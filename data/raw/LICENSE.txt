About the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Open Data Licence

The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) has developed this license as a tool to enable Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use of their Information under a common open license. The IMM invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this license. This is version 1.0 of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Open Data Licence. The IMM may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Open Data Licence.

These terms are compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 and the Open Data Commons Attribution License, both of which license copyright and database rights.
